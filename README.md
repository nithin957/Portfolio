## Projects
### FIFA Players Analytics â€“ R, Excel
[Link](https://github.com/nithin957/FIFA-Player-Performance-Analysis-and-Predictive-Modeling)
- Conducted extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on 18,483 FIFA player records, identifying key correlations and patterns in player attributes, market values, and wages. 
- Developed a Logistic regression model to classify players with high or low wages with 0.93 AUC score and a regularization model to predict 
players' potential ratings with 98.92% accuracy using R.
- Performed hypothesis testing to compare overall ratings between European and South American players, revealing statistically significant differences (p-value <0.05) and providing insights for regional scouting strategies.

### Used Car Price Analysis â€“ Python, Pandas, Matplotlib
[Link](https://github.com/nithin957/data-analysis-using-python)
- Cleaned and analyzed over 300,000 used car listings from eBay Germany using Pandas and NumPy.
- Identified price outliers, and missing values, and engineered features like age and mileage per year.
- Built regression models to predict car prices and visualized market trends with Matplotlib.

### Product Sales & Market Demographics Dashboard â€“ Tableau
[Link](https://github.com/nithin957/Product-Sales-Customer-Demographics-and-Market-Analysis-Dashboard-Tableau)
- Developed an interactive multi-dashboard solution to analyze product sales, customer demographics, and regional performance using Tableau and the Sample Superstore dataset.
- Uncovered key business insights such as the impact of education and occupation on sales, regional revenue trends, and customer growth patterns.
- Implemented advanced visualizations (dual-axis charts, cohort analysis, bar-in-bar, lollipop charts) and interactivity features (filters, parameters, drill-downs) to support strategic decision-making.

### Adaptive Loss vs ArcFace Loss â€“ PyTorch, Deep Learning
[Link](https://github.com/nithin957/Adaptive-vs-Arc-Loss-Cifar10-MNIST)
- Designed and implemented Adaptive Loss (AdaLoss) to dynamically adjust angular margins during training, improving upon traditional ArcFace Loss.
- Applied both loss functions to CNN models for MNIST and CIFAR-10, achieving notable accuracy improvements:
  - MNIST: 99.11% (AdaLoss) vs 97.86% (ArcFace)
  - CIFAR-10: 68.13% (AdaLoss) vs 62.35% (ArcFace)
- Demonstrated faster convergence and better generalization of AdaLoss, especially in high intra-class variance scenarios.
- Built and trained models using PyTorch, with complete evaluation pipelines and visual analysis.

### Swin Transformer vs Vision Transformer (ViT) â€“ PyTorch, Deep Learning
[Link](https://github.com/nithin957/Swin-vs-ViT-cifar10)
- Conducted a head-to-head comparison of Vision Transformer (ViT) and Swin Transformer on the CIFAR-10 image classification task to evaluate performance, training dynamics, and model complexity.
- ViT achieved higher test accuracy (91.65%) and faster convergence than Swin Transformer (90.46%), demonstrating superior performance under identical training conditions.
- Analyzed architectural trade-offs:
  - ViT: Flat structure, global self-attention, higher computational cost
  - Swin: Hierarchical, window-based attention with translation-invariant design
- Implemented both models in PyTorch, tracked metrics including accuracy, loss, and convergence over 200 epochs.
- Provided visual comparison of training curves, highlighting ViTâ€™s faster learning rate and lower loss values.



## Work Experience
 Data Analyst @ Blue Cross Blue Shield (_Aug 2024 â€“ Present_)
-  Built ETL workflows using SSIS and Azure Data Lake to extract, transform, and securely store hospital and claims data, improving efficiency and ensuring HIPAA-compliant handling of sensitive patient information.
-  Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) in Python and SQL on large-scale claims datasets to identify high-risk patients, detect readmission patterns, and provide actionable insights to improve patient care.
-  Developed predictive models in Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn) to stratify patient risk, enabling proactive interventions that reduced avoidable hospital readmissions and improved healthcare quality metrics.
-  Created interactive Tableau dashboards to monitor KPIs such as readmission rates, provider compliance, and treatment effectiveness, reducing manual reporting effort by ~70% and accelerating decision-making for clinical teams.
-  Collaborated with clinicians, IT, and compliance teams under Agile methodology, documenting BRD/FRD requirements in JIRA and Confluence to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and alignment with healthcare regulations.
-  Ensured strict adherence to HIPAA, CMS, and HEDIS compliance standards across all analytics, ETL, and reporting processes, strengthening data governance and regulatory accountability..
